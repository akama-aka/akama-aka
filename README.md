# Heya ![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/851511871773212694.webp?size=40&quality=lossless)


I hide under the name Akama Aka, I was born on February 4th and currently live in <redacted>,<redacted>. 
I am a programmer and hobby system administrator.

### About me

I've been working in the programming industry since about ~ 2015 but really only since 2021. I really got into programming through Minecraft plugins. Here I had my first contact with the programming language Java. Around 2020 I started programming Discord bots with the library discord.js. From then on I slipped further and further into the web development industry.
